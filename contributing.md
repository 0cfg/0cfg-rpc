## Steps for creating a successfull pull requests.
### 1. Make sure all checks are successfull.   
These checks assert that your branch can be build, tested and released.   

### 2. Assign one reviewer
The reviewer should be
- A developer
- Familiar with the topic of your change
- If possible not in vacation   
   
If multiple reviewers fit these criterias make sure to balance the work load between them.
   
If no reviewer fits these criterias then take the next best fit available.  
This reviewer may then merge the code without looking at it if he knows no better reviewer himself.

### 3. Contact your reviewer
A reviewer is **not** expected to check where he is asigned to.   
Instead you should let the person that you chose to review your code know that you are waiting on him.   
Tell him if the changes are urgent.

### 4. Take care of your PR
- If, as a result of the review, changes are necessary implement them and start at step 1 again.   
- If your changes are urgent you may convince the reviewer to accept changes without looking at them.
